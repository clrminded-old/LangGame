#Lang Game

Based of ChiliTomatoNoodles "PooGame"

The hope that I have this this is that I 
make some icons of some of the most
popular programming languges. 
Since C++ is the language that this game 
is being written in, its only fair to 
say that the C++ icon will be the one that
"eats" the other languages.

This project does get a lil complex through
out the tutorial. This is from the Basics 
of C++ class.
I have experience building these icons
before, so this hopefully will go pretty
quick.

I hope to add a score keeping icon too. 
More points for different languages, maybe 
I can use these with SnekGame which is 
following.
